        <h1>The Monster That Everyone Saw and No One Cared to Talk About</h1>

        <p>
          No one here wants to talk about the <strong>sea serpent</strong>. The
          docent at the <i>Maritime Museum</i> has heard about it, of
          course—everyone has—but it’s just some local legend. It doesn’t mean
          anything. At two different bookstores I stop into, nobody knows much
          about the sea serpent, but they both point me to the book Wayne
          Soini’s <i>The Gloucester Sea Serpent</i>. It is everywhere books are
          sold. It seems to be all Gloucester wants to say about their sea
          serpent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soini refers to the botched taxonomy job by the New England Linnaean
          Society as a “flop”: “because a Loblolly Cove snake distracted and
          confused” the committee, they “lost their chance at scientific
          acclaim.” The story of the sea serpent has become a story of a
          committee duped by a rickety snake and the limitations of taxonomy.
